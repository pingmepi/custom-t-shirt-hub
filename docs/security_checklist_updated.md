# 🔐 **Codebase Security Checklist – Custom T-shirt Design App**

## ✅ **1. Authentication & Authorization**
- ✅ **Implemented:** Supabase Auth configured with email domain restrictions or email confirmations if needed.
- ✅ **Implemented:** JWT tokens are validated on both client and server (e.g., during Supabase Function calls).
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No sensitive data (JWT, access tokens) stored in `localStorage`; use **HttpOnly cookies** where feasible.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Role-based UI logic matches Supabase RLS policies to avoid privilege escalation on the frontend.

---

## 📦 **2. API & Data Layer (Supabase)**
- ✅ **Implemented:** RLS policies are thoroughly tested for:
  - Unauthorized read/write protection.
  - Authenticated-only access.
  - Design ownership for user-saved designs and orders.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Supabase storage buckets set to **private** unless explicitly public (e.g., preview images).
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** API calls via Supabase client are scoped to the **minimum necessary tables/fields**.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No unscoped or `select *` queries in production.

---

## 🛡️ **3. Input Validation & Forms**
- ✅ **Implemented:** Zod schemas are implemented for **every form and user input**, both client-side and serverless functions.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Validation errors do not leak technical details (stack traces, etc.).
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Image uploads (e.g., custom designs) are validated for MIME type and size.

---

## 🎨 **4. Canvas & Design Editor**
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Input to the Canvas (e.g., text, images) is sanitized to prevent injection or DoS attacks.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** File export logic (e.g., downloading .png/.svg) doesn't leak user-specific data.
- ✅ **Implemented:** No access to other users' designs via predictable file paths or IDs.

---

## 🧩 **5. Frontend Code Practices**
- ✅ **Implemented:** Sensitive keys are injected via environment variables (`VITE_PUBLIC_` if needed).
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** React Query responses are sanitized before being rendered in UI.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No exposure of internal error messages in production (use `console.error` + toast fallback).
- ✅ **Implemented:** All modals/popups (Radix UI) respect focus trap and escape behavior (for accessibility and security).

---

## 🧪 **6. Testing & Static Analysis**
- ✅ **Implemented:** ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript in CI/CD to catch unsafe patterns.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Vitest includes coverage of:
  - Auth flows
  - Design save/export
  - Role-based access in UI
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Add Semgrep (optional) for static security scanning of frontend code.

---

## 🔑 **7. CI/CD & Environment Config**
- ✅ **Implemented:** No API keys or secrets pushed to Git (check with `git-secrets` or similar).
- ✅ **Implemented:** `.env` files ignored via `.gitignore`.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Vercel/Netlify environment variables scoped to project and team.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Limit Supabase service roles to specific use cases (e.g., admin dashboard).

---

## 🌐 **8. Browser-Side Protections**
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Secure headers added via Vercel/Netlify middleware:
  - `Content-Security-Policy`
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`
  - `X-Frame-Options`
  - `Referrer-Policy`
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Rate-limiting via Supabase edge functions (or alternative) on sensitive endpoints.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** CORS policies tightened if Supabase functions or API endpoints are called cross-origin.

---

## 🧾 **9. Miscellaneous**
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** No direct rendering of user input (e.g., usernames, design titles) without escaping.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Unused permissions and endpoints removed.
- ✅ **Implemented:** Designs and orders are associated with authenticated user IDs, verified before action.

---

## 🔭 **10. Optional Enhancements**
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Add basic anomaly detection (e.g., 10+ failed logins → lock account).
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Use [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) if any custom Express backend is introduced.
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Monitor usage via Supabase logs or integrate a lightweight analytics solution like PostHog with event-level privacy.
